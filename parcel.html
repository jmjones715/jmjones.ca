<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0">RapidResponse is a product that has been building and expanding over the years. At Kinaxis, many departments contribute to the product’s growth. However, there have been inconsistencies with some of the UI components. This happens because of misunderstandings due to unclear direction. Members of the UX team and Development Team pitched the idea of building a design system; a collection of UI components and guidelines. The design system’s name is Parcel.</p>

<!-- Problem/Objective -->
<div class="pad-t-2">
  {% pattern sections/problem-objective problem="The UX and Dev teams needed help designing and documenting the Design System’s pages. Also, the design system needed a visual identity, since it will be made available to Kinaxis’ clients in the future." objective="To design and document where each of our UI components are being used. I will need to review and update the UX style guide consistently, so that the Dev team can refer to it while creating design system components." %}

  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b-2 push-0 max-length-case-study">A design system is a lot more than just UI components. Design systems group all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product. This includes UI components, branding and identity, accessibility, technical documentation and a lot more.</p>
