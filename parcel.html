<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0">RapidResponse is a product that has been building and expanding over the years. At Kinaxis, many departments contribute to the product’s growth. However, there have been inconsistencies with some of the UI components. This happens because of misunderstandings due to unclear direction. Members of the UX team and Development Team pitched the idea of building a design system; a collection of UI components and guidelines. The design system’s name is Parcel.</p>

<!-- Problem/Objective -->
<div class="push-2">
  {% pattern sections/problem-objective problem="Parcel's documentation pages needed to be designed. Also, the design system needed a visual identity, since it will be made available to Kinaxis’ clients in the future." objective="To design and document where each of the UI components are being used. I will need to review and update the UX style guide consistently, so that the Dev team can refer to it while creating design system components." %}

<!-- Markdown -->

  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b-2 push-0">Before creating mock ups, I was asked to write all the documentation as markdown. This would allow the web developers to implement my documentation into their code. The markdown also served as a template, which I used as a guide while designing the rest of the documentation pages.</p>
  <blockquote class="main-dark-blue">“Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).”</blockquote>

  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-2">I wrote the markdown in a code editor called <i>Atom</i>.

I also realized how important it is to have consistent UI components, and how to create/update UI component documentation. Working on Parcel has also showed me how important it is to collaborate with web developers. It is important to communicate different ideas, and discuss limitations.</p>
