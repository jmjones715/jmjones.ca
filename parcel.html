<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0">RapidResponse is a product that has been building and expanding over the years. At Kinaxis, many departments contribute to the product’s growth. However, there have been inconsistencies with some of the UI components. This happens because of misunderstandings due to unclear direction. Members of the UX team and Development Team pitched the idea of building a design system; a collection of UI components and guidelines. The design system’s name is Parcel.</p>

<!-- Problem/Objective -->
<div class="pad-t-2">
  {% pattern sections/problem-objective problem="The UX and Dev teams needed help designing and documenting the Design System’s pages. Also, the design system needed a visual identity, since it will be made available to Kinaxis’ clients in the future." objective="To design and document where each of our UI components are being used. I will need to review and update the UX style guide consistently, so that the Dev team can refer to it while creating design system components." %}

<!-- What is a Design System -->

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 pad-t-2">It’s not just a Pattern Library</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b-2 push-0">A design system is a lot more than just UI components. Design systems group all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product. This includes UI components, branding and identity, accessibility, technical documentation and a lot more.</p>
  <blockquote class="main-dark-blue">“A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.”</blockquote>

<!-- Why Design System -->
<div class="island island-0 max-length">
  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 pad-t-2">Why a Design System?</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl gray bold center-l">A Design System is necessary because they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Promote UI consistency & cohesion</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Allow for faster, higher quality production</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Have shared vocabulary</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Are easier to test</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Are a useful reference</li>

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">It was decided that the design system components would be documented in Storybook. There are a few good reasons to use Storybook as the Design system platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">It makes it easy to build components in isolation, outside of your app.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">It increases developer awareness of existing components.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">It serves as a living style guide and documentation.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">It makes it easy to visually test edge cases.</li>

  <h3 class="jm-tera jm-tera-xxl center-l pad-t-2 bold main-dark-blue">Designing the Parcel Logo</h3>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-0">Before diving into Storybook documentation, I needed to create a visual identity for the design system.

<!-- Typography -->
{% pattern sections/typography text="I chose AgencyFB because of its strong build and athletic feel.
