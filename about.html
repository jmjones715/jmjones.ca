        <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-0 pad-b-1-2 left-m">Like every other graphic designer, I'm passionate about solving problems, making clean designs and visually expanding brand identities. But most people who know me will say that I'm just as passionate about fitness (powerlifting) as I am about design. Being active in the gym has influenced some of my work — I've also gotten used to designing for clients in the fitness industry.</p>
        <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl pad-t-1-8 left-m">I design because I love taking an idea and making it a reality. Seeing that idea grow and interact with others is one of my favourite feelings in the world. (Well, that and hitting a new deadlift max.)</p>
