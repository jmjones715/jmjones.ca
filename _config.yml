  rationales:
    colors.primary: |
      A gold colour was chosen to represent a more high-end and classy mood. It sets the tone for the site, and contrasts well against darker colours.
    colors.secondary: |
      This gray was chosen as a more neutral tone whic still allows the site to look clean and modern.
    colors.accent: |
      This colour was chosenmostly for the footer and body copy text, on whie sections.
    typefaces.primary: |
      Raleway was chosen because it is great for body copy text. It is also a simple font that suits a modern/classy theme.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Montserratwas chosen to be used fo headings. Its a bigger font, but still keeps that same modern feel.
