<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0">Fahel & Co is a property management firm based in Ottawa, Canada. Over 300 landlords in the city use their firm. Fahel & Co offers a variety of property management services to landlords, including: maintenance, property inspections, rent collection and tenant complaints. Fahel & Co actively gives back to the Ottawa community, supporting local charities such as CHEO.</p>

<!-- Problem & Objective -->
<div class="pad-b-2">
  {% pattern sections/problem-objective problem="The site lacked consistent visual branding, and was generally unorganized. Fahel & Co’s site needed to feel clean and modern, while still allowing users to easily access their services." objective="To improve the site’s user experience and layout. I’d also need to determine the site’s visual design, including: colours, typography, icons and graphics. Branding will be established and made consistent throughout the site." %}

<!-- Old Site -->
<div class="island island-0 max-length">
  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 pad-t-2">The Old Site</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b-2 push max-length-case-study">Fahel & Co’s old site was visually inconsistent with their brand. It lacked the professional feel they wanted their clients to experience. The site wasn’t using a proper grid layout, which made navigation and accessibility difficult for users.</p>

  <h3 class="jm-tera jm-tera-xxl center-l pad-t-2 bold main-dark-blue">Prototype</h3>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-2">After completing my background research, it was finally time to start designing. Before I could start redesigning the site's user interface, I had to draw some wireframes first. These wireframes helped me and the client visualize the site's structure, and how users would navigate through it.</p>

<!-- Wireframes -->

  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b-2 push-0 max-length-case-study">I created a low-fidelity wireframe for each web page. It was important for me to organize the site's content using grids systems. I knew that keeping content organized would greatly improve the accessiblity of this site for all users. A cleaner layout would also make the site look more professional.</p>
