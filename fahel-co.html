The brand sells merchandise such as t-shirts and hoodies. The road on which this Goodlife is located is called “Eagleson”; which local residents refer to as the “Eagleson Goodlife”. The name Eagle’s Nest comes from the street Eagleson as well as the fact that the trainers consider this location as their ‘home’ Goodlife. An eagle’s home is called a nest — which is where the brand name Eagle’s Nest came from.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l max-length-case-study push-0">The first thing I had to do was conduct research on Sustainable Development Goal #3. In order to accurately come up with a solution to this goal, I needed to fully understand what SDGs are, and who they would effect. After researching more about the chosen SDG, I needed to learn about the target audience and their interests, behaviours/characteristics and struggles.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Our primary target audience would consist of young adults. This is because out of any age group, people aged 18 - 24 are the most prone for substance use and abuse. It is more common for people aged in their mid/late 20’s to use illegal drugs as well to overdose on drugs, drink and drive, use prescription drugs, etc.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo bold push-1-2">Through research, I discovered that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">A large amount of people in this age group are interested in technology, alcohol and other substances. </li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Young adults tend to be moody, emotional and a bit rebellious.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Young adults are also self-aware and self-conscious.</li>

This was important because I needed to identify, analyze and compare how effective their solutions are at solving SDG goal #3. The analysis allowed me to draw inspiration from successful solutions, as well as to learn from and improve on their shortcomings.</p>
