The brand sells merchandise such as t-shirts and hoodies. The road on which this Goodlife is located is called “Eagleson”; which local residents refer to as the “Eagleson Goodlife”. The name Eagle’s Nest comes from the street Eagleson as well as the fact that the trainers consider this location as their ‘home’ Goodlife. An eagle’s home is called a nest — which is where the brand name Eagle’s Nest came from.</p>

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l pad-t-2 bold main-dark-blue">Stage 1: Research</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l max-length-case-study push-0">The first thing I had to do was conduct research on Sustainable Development Goal #3. In order to accurately come up with a solution to this goal, I needed to fully understand what SDGs are, and who they would effect. After researching more about the chosen SDG, I needed to learn about the target audience and their interests, behaviours/characteristics and struggles.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), are essentially milestones which act as a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Out of the 17 total SDG goals, I chose to help solve goal #3; good health and well-being. This goal attempts to increase the overall health and wellness of people worldwide.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo push-0 bold main-dark-blue">This project is centred around combating substance use & abuse.</p>

      <h4 class="jm-giga extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2">Target Audience</h4>
      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Our primary target audience would consist of young adults. This is because out of any age group, people aged 18 - 24 are the most prone for substance use and abuse. It is more common for people aged in their mid/late 20’s to use illegal drugs as well to overdose on drugs, drink and drive, use prescription drugs, etc.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo bold push-1-2">Through research, I discovered that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">A large amount of people in this age group are interested in technology, alcohol and other substances. </li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Young adults tend to be moody, emotional and a bit rebellious.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Young adults are also self-aware and self-conscious.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Almost 70% of young adults suffer from anxiety and  depression.</li>

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l push-1-2 max-length-case-study">Based on my background research, I analyzed the main pain-points and how the app could become an effective solution to these problems. This is the statement I ended up with:</p>
  <p class="jm-mega center-l push-0 pad-t-2 pad-b-2 bold main-dark-blue pstate-max-length-l">"Young adults need a way to easily access support groups because they are struggling to overcome substance abuse on their own."</p>

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-t-2 pad-b-1-2">Competitor Analysis</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l push-1-2 max-length-case-study">Before diving into ideation and sketching, I conducted a competitor analysis on 3 existing sobriety apps. This was important because I needed to identify, analyze and compare how effective their solutions are at solving SDG goal #3. The analysis allowed me to draw inspiration from successful solutions, as well as to learn from and improve on their shortcomings.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4 class="jm-mega push-1-2 max-length-case-study">Sober Grid</h4>
      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2 max-length-case-study">Sober Grid is a free app where people who are trying to get sober or have achieved sobriety can connect with each other. Users can find friends, get support or help others.</p>

      <h4 class="jm-mega push-1-2 max-length-case-study">AlcoDroid Alcohol Tracker</h4>
      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2 max-length-case-study">AlcoDroid Alcohol Tracker is a free app for android users that allows the user to keep track of their drinking habits. The app can also be used to keep track of how much a person is drinking a day, week, or month to help keep them from abusing alcohol.</p>

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l pad-t-2 bold main-dark-blue">Stage 2: Design</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l max-length-case-study push-0">After completing my research, comparing existing solutions and figuring out user pain points, it was finally time to start designing. I started with brainstorming ideas on paper, which eventually lead to my first sitemap. Before sketching the app, I needed to know how the app’s task would flow.</p>

Once I finalized the site map, I could now move on to transforming these tasks into a low-fidelity prototype.</p>
