The brand sells merchandise such as t-shirts and hoodies. The road on which this Goodlife is located is called “Eagleson”; which local residents refer to as the “Eagleson Goodlife”. The name Eagle’s Nest comes from the street Eagleson as well as the fact that the trainers consider this location as their ‘home’ Goodlife. An eagle’s home is called a nest — which is where the brand name Eagle’s Nest came from.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l max-length-case-study push-0">First, I conducted background research on Fahel & Co as a company. In order to accurately redesign their site in a way that could attract new customers, I needed to fully understand what the companies' vision, target audience and unique selling point(s) were.

      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Fahel & Co is one of, if not, the fastest growing property management firms in Ottawa. Their main goal is to help landloards maximaize their profits and to minimize their vacancies. Overall, Fahel & Co aims to reduce the stress of maintaining property for landloards.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Because of how fast they are growing, Fahel & Co have been rapidly expanding their brand. Their next step was to update their website, since a large number of their clients look for listings online.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo bold push-1-2">Through research, I discovered that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">About half of property managers are self-employed, and that almost all of them work out of an office.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">As a landlord, you would have to deal with challenges such as repairs and collecting rent.</li>

The app uses a third shade of blue, which is also the lightest shade of the 3 blues. This blue is used for text message bubbles, and highlights. The app also uses lots of white space, to create a sense of cleanliness. Finally, the gray is used for text and certain buttons/icons.</p>
