This app lets users connect with others going through similar struggles within their community. Anocate prioritizes anonymity, with features such as auto deleting messages and hiding aspects of the userâ€™s profile. The goal was to create an easier way for members to communicate with each other through support groups, without worrying about giving away personal information.</p>
