<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 push-0 center-l">The Granite Importer (TGI), is an Ottawa family owned business which offers custom fabrication services. They offer services for kitchen/bathroom countertops, fireplace surrounds, backsplashes, etc. Custom fabrication means that TGI can provide both product production and design. They acquire stone slabs from the quarries in other countries such as Brazil, Italy, Spain, India, Turkey, and more.</p>

{% pattern sections/project-objective title="Project Objective" text="The redesign should incorporate new elements that will improve the design, as well as to attract new and existing consumers.

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l pad-b-2 push-0 max-length-case-study">This is the current logo for TGI. The logo is too text heavy and lacks any unique design elements. The logo seems to be confused about the brand name, and it doesn't resonate well with the target audience.</p>

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 margin-t-2">Research</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l max-length-case-study">First, I had to do background research and perform a <a class="jm-kilo bold open-sans" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PiUJBjXtm73PpL3OLQqq1QBUS3qGrsy2U6H9Eryx-ic/edit?usp=sharing">brand audit</a>. Through research, I discovered TGI's main target audience, their unique selling point and their main competitors. With this new found knowledge on the brand, I made a presentation which outlined my brand strategy on how to improve the current logo. I also made a moodboard to visualize my thought direction for the new brand.</p>

        <h4 class="jm-mega main-blue push-0 pad-b-1-2">Target Audience</h4>
        <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">The Granite Importer primarily targets older adults aged 45 - 55 and up who are looking to refurbish their homes (specifically kitchen countertops, fireplaces, etc.). Older adults tend to spend more on homes than younger adults (due to typical higher income and having more time to plan renovations). TGI also targets young adults who are moving into their first homes and would like to refurbish while getting settled in.</p>

        <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">TGI acquires stone slabs from the quarries in the countries such as Brazil, India, Spain, Italy and Turkey. TGI focuses solely on custom fabrication — they provide both production and design assistance. Custom fabrication allows for more creative work, which can help a customer’s kitchen/bathroom ‘pop’. By focusing on the design aspect more, TGI’s product appears to be visually more attractive; which is what the customers want their homes to be.</p>

<h4 class="jm-giga extra-bold dark-gray center-l gutter margin-t push-0 pad-b-1-2">Process: Drafting</h4>
<p class="center-l jm-kilo max-length-case-study push-2 gutter">I started the design process by sketching over 20 concepts. I reviewed these ideas with the client and fellow graphic designers. After selecting the 2 best concepts, I did another round of sketching. I ended up with over 10 variations of the 2 concepts. After more reviewing and consulting, a final concept was chosen for refinement.</p>

I tweeked the negative space between the shapes that made up the icon, to improve legibility on smaller sizes. I also experimented with coulours that I thought would reflect TGI's brand well.</p>

{% pattern sections/final-design title="Final Design" text="The concept of the logo is the letter 'G' that is formed by slabs of granite or stone.

{% pattern sections/typography text="These fonts were chosen to portray a modern and structured feel to the brand. Because TGI works with stone, I decided to go with a bold and solid font like Impact. The bold font also portrays a sense of confidence, which TGI has in their product and services.

This font was chosen for 2 reasons: to show contrast from the heavy Impact font, and to portray the modern, high-end feel of the brand." font-1="Impact" image-font-1="/images/tgi/fonts/impact.png" font-2="Trade Gothic Next Pro (Bold Condensed)" image-font-2="/images/tgi/fonts/trade-gothic.png" %}

The combination of these colours make the brand appear more polished and sleek; just like their countertops.</p>
