<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 push-0">Anocate was designed as a solution for one of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a social network/messaging app for people struggling with substance abuse. This app lets users connect with others going through similar struggles within their community. Anocate prioritizes anonymity, with features such as auto deleting messages and hiding aspects of the user’s profile.</p>

<!-- Problem/Objective -->
<div class="pad-t-2">
  {% pattern sections/problem-objective problem="A large majority of young adults are abusing substances. It’s an issue that damages people physically and mentally. Young adults need a way to access support and guidance, since overcoming an addiction is very challenging on its own." objective="My task was to provide an app solution for Sustainable Development Goal #3 (good-health & well-being). I had to thoroughly understand this goal and the target demographic, so I could create a working solution." %}

  <h4 class="jm-tera jm-tera-xxl center-l pad-t-2 bold main-dark-blue">Research & Discovery</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-0">The first thing I had to do was conduct research on Sustainable Development Goal #3. In order to accurately come up with a solution to this goal, I needed to fully understand what SDGs are, and who they would effect. After researching more about the chosen SDG, I needed to learn about the target audience and their interests, behaviours/characteristics and struggles.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), are essentially milestones which act as a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">Out of the 17 total SDG goals, I chose to help solve goal #3; good health and well-being. This goal attempts to increase the overall health and wellness of people worldwide.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">The primary target audience would consist of young adults. This is because out of any age group, people aged 18 - 24 are the most prone for substance use and abuse. It is more common for people aged in their mid/late 20’s to use illegal drugs as well to overdose on drugs, drink and drive, use prescription drugs, etc.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl bold push-1-2">Through research, I discovered that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">A large amount of people in this age group are interested in technology, alcohol and other substances.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Young adults tend to be moody, emotional and a bit rebellious.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Young adults are also self-aware and self-conscious.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Almost 70% of young adults suffer from anxiety and  depression.</li>

  <p class="jm-kilo push-2">Before diving into ideation and sketching, I conducted a competitor analysis on 3 existing sobriety apps. This was important because I needed to identify, analyze and compare how effective their solutions are at solving SDG goal #3. The analysis allowed me to draw inspiration from successful solutions, as well as to learn from and improve on their shortcomings.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl pad-b push-0 max-length-case-study">I asked 5 of my fellow classmates to test my paper prototype, and I recorded their feedback.

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">The main cause of friction in the prototype was the iconography. This is simply because a lot of the icons are very similar to each other, which could confuse the user. Another cause of friction was the lack of confirmations on certain tasks. When a message has been sent or a friend has been added, it is important to let the user know that those tasks have been completed. Overall, Iconography and confirmations would be the biggest causes of friction for my prototype.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">Mainly, to improve the iconography on the toolbar. The icons will be designed to look more different and obvious to their related tasks. The icons could perhaps have labels underneath so that users can know exactly what clicking on each icon will allow them to do. The next iteration of the app will also have more confirmations of tasks. There will be more pop up windows that will notify users when a task has been completed, or when something in the app has or is about to change.</p>

        <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">Instead of having search groups, search people and create groups as separate pages, I condensed them to improve the app’s usability. 2 tabs have been added to the search page; one that allows users to search for groups and the other for people. On the groups page, users can now easily view posts from the groups they have joined, as well as to create a group on the same page.</p>

        <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">The aim for the app’s design was to make it feel light and inviting. People struggling with an addiction may have a lot on their mind. So seeing an app that’s clear and easy to use would be appropriate. The app design incorporates lots of white space, clear new icons with labels and content organized in grid systems.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0 max-length-case-study">I reworked my original site map, and decided to combine some of the tasks into under the same page. For example, I decided to let users search for people and groups under the search page, instead of having a separate page fr searching for a group and for people. Condensing the tasks have made the app flow more natural; it also enables better app navigation, because it is more organized.</p>

Implementing the new ideas made the app feel more organic, and catered towards the target audience. The icons are also more clear, and icon labels have been added just incase the user does’t understand the meaning of the icons." %}
