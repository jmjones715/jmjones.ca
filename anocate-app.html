This app lets users connect with others going through similar struggles within their community. Anocate prioritizes anonymity, with features such as auto deleting messages and hiding aspects of the user’s profile. The goal was to create an easier way for members to communicate with each other through support groups, without worrying about giving away personal information.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l max-length-case-study push-0">The first thing I had to do was conduct research on Sustainable Development Goal #3. In order to accurately come up with a solution to this goal, I needed to fully understand what SDGs are, and who they would effect. After researching more about the chosen SDG, I needed to learn about the target audience and their interests, behaviours/characteristics and struggles.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), are essentially milestones which act as a call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Out of the 17 total SDG goals, I chose to help solve goal #3; good health and well-being. This goal attempts to increase the overall health and wellness of people worldwide.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Our primary target audience would consist of young adults. This is because out of any age group, people aged 18 - 24 are the most prone for substance use and abuse. It is more common for people aged in their mid/late 20’s to use illegal drugs as well to overdose on drugs, drink and drive, use prescription drugs, etc.</p>
      <p class="jm-kilo bold push-1-2">Through research, I discovered that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">A large amount of people in this age group are interested in technology, alcohol and other substances. </li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Young adults tend to be moody, emotional and a bit rebellious.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Young adults are also self-aware and self-conscious.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Almost 70% of young adults suffer from anxiety and  depression.</li>

  <p class="jm-mega center-l push-0 pad-t-2 pad-b-2 bold main-dark-blue pstate-max-length-l">"Young adults need a way to easily access support groups because they are struggling to overcome substance abuse on their own."</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l push-1-2 max-length-case-study">Before diving into ideation and sketching, I conducted a competitor analysis on 3 existing sobriety apps. This was important because I needed to identify, analyze and compare how effective their solutions are at solving SDG goal #3. The analysis allowed me to draw inspiration from successful solutions, as well as to learn from and improve on their shortcomings.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">The main cause of friction in the prototype was the iconography. This is simply because a lot of the icons are very similar to each other, which could confuse the user. Another cause of friction was the lack of confirmations on certain tasks.

Overall, Iconography and confirmations would be the biggest causes of friction for my prototype.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Mainly, to improve the iconography on the toolbar. The icons will be designed to look more different and obvious to their related tasks. The icons could perhaps have labels underneath so that users can know exactly what clicking on each icon will allow them to do. The next iteration of the app will also have more confirmations of tasks. There will be more pop up windows that will notify users when a task has been completed, or when something in the app has or is about to change.</p>

<div class="island island-0">
  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-t-2 pad-b-1-2">New Ideas</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l pad-b push-0 max-length-case-study">I decided to focus the app more on anonymity, support groups and user communication.

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l push-0 pad-b-2 bold main-dark-blue pstate-max-length-l">Listed below are the new ideas I have implemented to the current app.</p>

Accessible through the settings menu, users can toggle on/off auto delete. From there, the user can set a time (from 30 min - 24 hours) before all messages get erased. This will ensure users that nothing they do on this app is permanent, and that their history is not being recorded.</p>

        <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Instead of having search groups, search people and create groups as separate pages, I condensed them to improve the app’s usability. 2 tabs have been added to the search page; one that allows users to search for groups and the other for people. On the groups page, users can now easily view posts from the groups they have joined, as well as to create a group on the same page.</p>

So seeing an app that’s clear and easy to use would be appropriate. The app design incorporates lots of white space, clear new icons with labels and content organized in grid systems.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l pad-b-2 push-0 max-length-case-study">I reworked my original site map, and decided to combine some of the tasks into under the same page. For example, I decided to let users search for people and groups under the search page, instead of having a separate page fr searching for a group and for people. Condensing the tasks have made the app flow more natural; it also enables better app navigation, because it is more organized.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l pad-b push-0 max-length-case-study">This project was my first time designing a mobile app from the ground up using the proper UX methods. I’ve learned how important it is to do background research, so you can understand who to design for and why. Usability testing is also one of the most important parts of this journey, because with out feedback from actual users, the I would have no concrete way to improve the usability to satisfy user needs.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l pad-b push-0 max-length-case-study">Now that the app has been finalized (for now), I have focused more on the branding aspects such as logo design, and ad campaigns. In the future, I would like to further test this prototype so that it can reach a stage where I wouldn’t have thought imaginable. Perhaps, something like this app could become a reality, and are a difference in people’s lives.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l push-0 pad-b pad-t-1-2 bold main-dark-blue pstate-max-length-l">But wait, there’s still more! I also designed the app’s logo and advertising.</p>
