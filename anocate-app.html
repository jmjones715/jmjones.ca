<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 push-0 border-t">Anocate was designed as a solution for one of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a social network/messaging app for people struggling with substance abuse. This app lets users connect with others going through similar struggles within their community. Anocate prioritizes anonymity, with features such as auto deleting messages and hiding aspects of the user’s profile.</p>

<!-- Problem/Objective -->
<div class="pad-t-2 pad-b-2">
  {% pattern sections/problem-objective problem="A large majority of young adults are abusing substances. It’s an issue that damages people physically and mentally. Young adults need a way to access support and guidance, since overcoming an addiction is very challenging on its own." objective="My task was to provide an app solution for Sustainable Development Goal #3 (good-health & well-being). I had to thoroughly understand this goal and the target demographic, so that I could design a working solution." %}

  <p class="jm-kilo push-0 max-length-case-study">I decided to let users search for people and groups on the search page. It makes more sense than having a page for each task. This enables better organization and app navigation.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo push">This was my first time designing a mobile app using proper UX methods. My market research helped me understand how the target users think and feel. Usability testing was a critical part of the UX process; without feedback from users, I couldn't improve the usability of the app. </p>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-2">At the time of this project, some UX methods weren't indroduced to me yet (such as interviews, surveys and data analysis). If I were to redo this project, I would include those methods in my UX process.</p>
