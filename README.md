I grew up in a family with artistic talents, so thinking creatively felt pretty natural to me. Ever since I started studying Graphic Design, I've started to instinctively analyze existing brands and user interfaces. I'm always asking myself questions like: "how could I make this logo more creative and help the business target their primary audience." Or "how could I redesign this user interface to make it more efficient and visually appealing?".

I believe that a good design should not only look nice, but also have a reason — a purpose. And one of the most satisfying feelings in the world, is being able to help clients solve these problems with my skillset and knowledge.
