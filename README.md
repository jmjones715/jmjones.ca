As someone who grew up in a family with artistic talents, thinking creatively felt natural to me. Ever since I started studying Graphic Design, I started to analyze existing brands and user interface design. Nowadays, I pass by logos on local businesses and I always ask myself what I would do to improve the design — how could I make the logo more creative and help the business target their primary audience.
