<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 push-0 center-l">Autism World Travel (AWT) is an up and coming business which offers travel solutions/recommendations for patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). AWT is partnered with ASD clinics at the traveler’s destination. This business is a unique form of Medical Tourism. Medical Tourism is when one person travels to another country in order to receive medical, dental and surgical care.</p>

{% pattern sections/project-objective text="The logo must incorporate design elements that will attract the main target audience.

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 margin-t-2">Research</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo center-l max-length-case-study">Before I could get started on the design, I had to do background research and perform a <a class="jm-kilo bold open-sans" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7cTZidIgg9EESSx891hxfJ88J2TxBiy07tT1g2pvxc/edit#">brand audit</a>. Through research, I discovered AWT's main target audience, their unique selling point and their main competitors. With this new found knowledge, I made a presentation which outlined my brand strategy on how to develop an effective logo. I also made a couple of moodboards to visualize my thought direction for the new brand.</p>

        <h4 class="jm-mega main-blue push-0 pad-b-1-2">Target Audience</h4>
        <p class="jm-kilo push-1-2">Primarily clients from countries which are lacking in or don’t have clinical solutions for ASD. Some targeted countries include: Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Russia. AWT targets people of any gender, age, race, ethnic or economic group. Families who are looking for an easy solution for travelling with others diagnosed with ASD will be one of the main target audiences as well. The main goal for AWT is to help families destress about travelling with ASD passengers.</p>

        <h4 class="jm-mega main-blue push-0 pad-b-1-2">Unique Selling Point</h4>
        <p class="jm-kilo push-0">AWT’s whole concept could be considered as a unique selling point. Most Medical Tourism offers healthcare such as heart surgeries, dental care, plastic surgery, cosmetic surgery, etc.  That being said, there are not a lot of businesses that offer Medical Tourism specifically for ASD patients. This also means there is very little competition for AWT, due to how niche the business market is.</p>

    <p class="jm-kilo center-l push-2 max-length-case-study">The iconic 'puzzle piece' symbol is actually somewhat controversial. Some find it offensive, because the puzzle piece may portray people with ASD as outcasts who 'don't fit into society'. This was both interesting and important to learn. Knowing this changed my approach towards the project; I now had to come up with a unique way to tie in Autism and travelling without the puzzle piece.</p>

<p class="center-l jm-kilo max-length-case-study push-2 gutter">I started the design process by sketching over 20 concepts. I reviewed these ideas with the client and fellow graphic designers. After selecting the 2 best concepts, I did another round of sketching. I ended up with over 10 variations of the 2 concepts. After more reviewing and consulting, a final concept was chosen for refinement.</p>

After brainstorming name ideas, we finally came up with a name that reflects the brand's service, without feeling to clinical.</p>
