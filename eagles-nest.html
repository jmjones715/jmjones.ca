The brand sells merchandise such as t-shirts and hoodies. The road on which this Goodlife is located is called “Eagleson”; which local residents refer to as the “Eagleson Goodlife”. The name Eagle’s Nest comes from the street Eagleson as well as the fact that the trainers consider this location as their ‘home’ Goodlife. An eagle’s home is called a nest — which is where the brand name Eagle’s Nest came from.</p>

<p class="text-center jm-kilo max-length-case-study push-2 gutter">After getting the go ahead from the client, I made multiple revisions to the concept. I added in more shading to make the logo more confident and striking. I added negative space to create balance in the design. I ended up with 4 variations, each with slightly different colour placements.</p>
