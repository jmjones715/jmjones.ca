The road on which this Goodlife is located is called “Eagleson”; which local residents refer to as the “Eagleson Goodlife”. The name Eagle’s Nest is a pun on the street Eagleson as well as the fact that the trainers consider this location as their ‘home’ Goodlife. An eagle’s home is called a nest — which is where the brand name Eagle’s Nest came from.</p>
