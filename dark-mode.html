<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0">During my time as a visual design intern, my manager tasked me with designing a dark theme for our product: RapidResponse. I was assigned to create a dark mode for a specific platform of RapiResponse called: The New Planning Experience. I needed to explore how other products approach theming, so that I could apply it to RapidResponse. The final designs are being considered for future roadmaps.</p>

<!-- Why Dark Mode? -->

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 pad-t-2">It offers more than what suits us</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b-2 push-0 max-length-case-study">Having a dark theme gives users a choice in how to interact with the New Planning Experience. Giving people a choice in how to interact with our company is basic & should be obvious. Ultimately, a dark theme gives customers the power to make choices that suit them.</p>
  <blockquote class="main-dark-blue">“Giving people the choice in how they interact with your company is as basic and should be as obvious as offering them a choice of models. Combining traditional channels with mobile and social ones and optimizing all of them to give control to the consumer is in and of itself an extremely strong message which states that you are giving your customers the power to make the choices which suit them and not just offering what suits you.”</blockquote>

  <h3 class="jm-tera jm-tera-xxl center-l pad-t-2 bold main-dark-blue">Research & Discovery</h3>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-0">I based most of my research on Material Design’s Guidelines. The reason why I chose to look there, is also because a lot of RapidResponse’s UI components are inspired by Material Design. I also consulted a fellow designer who has worked with dark theming before. He gave me some insights that proved helpful to my design process.</p>

<!-- Principles -->
<div class="island island-0 max-length">
  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 pad-t-2">Principles</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 gray bold">There are some key design principles that Material Design has outlined in the design system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Majority of space is dedicated to dark surfaces.</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Accent colours should be limited.</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Meet accessibility standards to accommodate users.</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Components express depth by using lighter surface colours</li>
    <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Colours are desaturated for accessibility</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Properties -->

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 pad-t-2">Properties</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 gray bold">Dark gray surfaces express wider range of colour, elevation & depth than black.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2">Desaturated colours avoid eye-strain & are better for legibility. Tonal colour palettes can help meet accessibility standards. The example on the right is a tonal colour picker from Material Design’s website. Brand colours use full saturation in a dark theme. (ex: Brand Logos).</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Are typically white and black.</li>
        <li class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-1-2 main-blue semi-bold">Are white on dark backgrounds, and black on light backgrounds.</li>

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-t-2 pad-b-1-2">The Next Steps</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0">This project was my first time designing a mobile app from the ground up using the proper UX methods. I’ve learned how important it is to do background research, so you can understand who to design for and why. Usability testing is also one of the most important parts of this journey, because with out feedback from actual users, the I would have no concrete way to improve the usability to satisfy user needs.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0">Now that the app has been finalized (for now), I have focused more on the branding aspects such as logo design, and ad campaigns. In the future, I would like to further test this prototype so that it can reach a stage where I wouldn’t have thought imaginable. Perhaps, something like this app could become a reality, and are a difference in people’s lives.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo push-0 pad-b pad-t-1-2 bold main-dark-blue">But wait, there’s still more! I also designed the app’s logo and advertising.</p>
