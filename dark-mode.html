<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0">During my time as a visual design intern, my manager tasked me with designing a dark theme for our product: RapidResponse. I was assigned to create a dark mode for a specific platform of RapiResponse called: The New Planning Experience. I needed to explore how other products approach theming, so that I could apply it to RapidResponse. The final designs are being considered for future roadmaps.</p>

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-t-2 pad-b-1-2">The Next Steps</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0">This project was my first time designing a mobile app from the ground up using the proper UX methods. I’ve learned how important it is to do background research, so you can understand who to design for and why. Usability testing is also one of the most important parts of this journey, because with out feedback from actual users, the I would have no concrete way to improve the usability to satisfy user needs.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0">Now that the app has been finalized (for now), I have focused more on the branding aspects such as logo design, and ad campaigns. In the future, I would like to further test this prototype so that it can reach a stage where I wouldn’t have thought imaginable. Perhaps, something like this app could become a reality, and are a difference in people’s lives.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo push-0 pad-b pad-t-1-2 bold main-dark-blue">But wait, there’s still more! I also designed the app’s logo and advertising.</p>
