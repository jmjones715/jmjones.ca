<!-- Project Overview -->
<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0">During my time as a visual design intern, my manager tasked me with designing a dark theme for our product: RapidResponse. More specifically, for the web client (aka: The New Planning Experience). I needed to explore how other products approach theming, so that I could apply it to the New Planning Experience. The final designs are concepts that are being considered for future roadmaps.</p>

<!-- Why Dark Mode? -->
{% pattern sections/project-objective title="Why Dark Mode?" text="Dark themes are beneficial because they help reduce eyestrain. They facilitate screen use in darker environments, and help conserve battery power." image="/images/dark-mode/why-dark-mode-2.png" %}

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-b-1-2 pad-t-2">It offers more than what suits us</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b-2 push-1-2 max-length-case-study">Having a dark theme gives users a choice in how to interact with the New Planning Experience. Giving people a choice in how to interact with the product is basic & should be obvious. Ultimately, a dark theme gives customers the power to make choices that suit them.</p>
  <blockquote class="jm-kilo jm-kilo-xxl semi-bold main-dark-blue push">“Giving people the choice in how they interact with your company is as basic and should be as obvious as offering them a choice of models. Combining traditional channels with mobile and social ones and optimizing all of them to give control to the consumer is in and of itself an extremely strong message which states that you are giving your customers the power to make the choices which suit them and not just offering what suits you.”</blockquote>

  <h3 class="jm-tera jm-tera-xxl center-l pad-t-2 bold main-dark-blue">Research & Discovery</h3>
  <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push-2 pad-b-2">I based most of my research on Material Design’s dark mode guidelines. This was because most of RapidResponse’s UI components are inspired by Material Design. I also consulted a fellow designer who has worked with dark theming before. He gave me some insights that proved helpful to my design process.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push">Dark mode surface colours should be dark gray instead of black. This is because dark gray surfaces express wider range of colour, elevation & depth than black.</p>

      <p class="jm-kilo jm-body-xxl push">Higher surface elevations become lighter. This is done with placing semi-transparent (white) overlays on the surface colour. Transparent colour overlays ensure consistency on different surface elevations.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo dm-text jm-body-xxl dm-text push-1-2">The next step was to determine the lightness of overlapping surfaces. I created a table which organized the UI components/surfaces and elevation levels. This was an iterative process — I had to test each UI surface at each elevation level.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo dm-text jm-body-xxl dm-text push-0">Figuring out elevation levels for the UI was challenging, since the RapidResponse product is a lot larger and more complex than a regular mobile app. Many components were decided to have multiple elevation levels depending on specific use cases.</p>

  <h4 class="jm-giga center-l extra-bold dark-gray push-0 pad-t-2 pad-b-1-2">Reflection & Next Steps</h4>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0">This project taught me a lot about theming. Material Design’s guidelines made me realize how important colour accessibility is in UI design. Learning about elevation levels for dark themes was also a big part of initial research. I realize that theming is more than just swapping out colours — and that there’s a reason behind every decision. After all, dark themes are designed to satisfy the user.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-2">I presented my concepts and research to both the UX and front-end development teams. My designs were positively received, and the dark theme is now being considered for the 2021 product roadmap! Future steps for the dark theme include visualization & charting colours. I will work with the development team to implement dark mode to the Parcel Design System.</p>
