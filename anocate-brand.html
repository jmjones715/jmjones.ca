This app lets users connect with others going through similar struggles within their community. Anocate prioritizes anonymity, with features such as auto deleting messages and hiding aspects of the user’s profile. The goal was to create an easier way for members to communicate with each other through support groups, without worrying about giving away personal information.</p>

  {% pattern sections/project-objective text="The aim of this logo redesign was to make the brand feel more inviting to users struggling with substance abuse. AnitDiction, the original name of the brand/app, was too negative and combined two words together that gave a false meaning of the app. The logo also needed to be used on many screen sizes and printed elements." image="/images/anocate/brand/anocate-phone.png" %}

  <p class="jm-kilo center-l pad-b-2 push-0 max-length-case-study">The name is too negative and the design is uninspired and underwhelming. The name and icon promote too much negativity, instead of promoting a welcoming and secure feel. The old logo may not make people feel comfortable using the product, which is important because that is the primary goal of the brand.</p>

<p class="center-l jm-kilo max-length-case-study push-2 gutter">I started the design process by brainstorming ideas (mind-mapping); then I started sketching them all on paper. One concept stuck with me; it was simple and effective. The concept was the letter 'a' in a form a of a speech bubble. After choosing the concept, I started building the logo on Illustrator. Once I had the general shape, it was time for me to refine the logo so that it looked polished.</p>

I smoothed out the edges of the logo, and rounded the corners to make it feel friendlier. I also changed the typeface to match the feel of the logo, and experimented with different shades of blue.</p>
