<p class="jm-kilo case-max-length-m case-max-length-l gutter no-gutter case-max-length-xl pad-t-2 pad-b-2 push-0 border-t">I decided to polish the visual design and branding for Anocate. I designed the logo — I also decided on other elements such as colour, typography and iconography. The goal was to create a look and feel that would emphasize openness and security. Because substance abuse is a sensitive and personal topic, I wanted to make the brand feel friendly and approachable.</p>

{% pattern sections/final-design title="Logo Design" text="The icon is simple and works on any screen size. The concept is straightforward and gets the message across. The colours were changed to a lighter blue, to make the logo feel friendlier, and the fonts were changed to be more readable, friendly and welcoming." image="/images/anocate/brand/anocate-logo-1.png" %}

{% pattern sections/typography text="These fonts were chosen to reflect the brand Anocate, as well as to ensure high level legiblity to the app users.

    <p class="jm-kilo push-0">Blue was chosen as Anocate's primary colour, because it is a trusting colour. The shades of blue being used are also lighter, which makes the brand feel more calm and inviting. The darker blue is used as contrast against the primary blue; it is primarily used for type. The app uses a third shade of blue, which is also the lightest shade of the 3 blues. This blue is used for text message bubbles, and highlights. The app also uses lots of white space, to create a sense of cleanliness. Finally, the gray is used for text and certain buttons/icons.</p>

    The poster visually attracts viewers with 7 total app screens. Showing the app screens will give users an idea on what the app looks like, which will push them into downloading it.</p>

  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0">This project was my first time designing a mobile app from the ground up using the proper UX methods. I’ve learned how important it is to do background research, so you can understand who to design for and why. Usability testing is also one of the most important parts of this journey, because with out feedback from actual users, the I would have no concrete way to improve the usability to satisfy user needs.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo pad-b push-0">Now that the app has been finalized (for now), I have focused more on the branding aspects such as logo design, and ad campaigns. In the future, I would like to further test this prototype so that it can reach a stage where I wouldn’t have thought imaginable. Perhaps, something like this app could become a reality, and are a difference in people’s lives.</p>
  <p class="jm-kilo push-0 pad-b pad-t-1-2 bold main-dark-blue">But wait, there’s still more! I also designed the app’s logo and advertising.</p>
